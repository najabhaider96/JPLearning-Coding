# ðŸ“š Function Notes

The `SSLClient.cpp` file provides a comprehensive suite of functions for handling SSL/TLS connections in an Arduino environment, particularly for the ESP32. These functions can be categorized into several key areas of functionality, which are essential for understanding the library's capabilities. Here's a user guide to the functionality based on the documentation blocks of these functions:

## Error Handling
- **`_handle_error(int err, const char* function, int line)`**: This function is used internally to handle errors. It interprets the error code returned by various SSL operations and logs it for debugging purposes.

## Network Communication
- **`client_net_recv(void *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t len)`**: Receives data over an established SSL connection. It checks for a valid client context and returns the number of bytes received or an error code.
- **`client_net_recv_timeout(void *ctx, unsigned char *buf, size_t len, uint32_t timeout)`**: Similar to `client_net_recv`, but with an additional timeout parameter. It's useful for non-blocking operations.
- **`client_net_send(void *ctx, const unsigned char *buf, size_t len)`**: Sends data over an SSL connection. It ensures that the client is properly initialized and connected before sending data.

## Initialization and Cleanup
- **`ssl_init(sslclient_context *ssl_client, Client *client)`**: Initializes the SSL context with default values and sets up necessary SSL configurations.
- **`cleanup(sslclient_context *ssl_client, bool ca_cert_initialized, bool client_cert_initialized, bool client_key_initialized, int ret, const char *rootCABuff, const char *cli_cert, const char *cli_key)`**: Frees allocated resources and stops the SSL socket if an error occurred during SSL operations.

## SSL Client Start and Configuration
- **`start_ssl_client(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *host, uint32_t port, int timeout, const char *rootCABuff, const char *cli_cert, const char *cli_key, const char *pskIdent, const char *psKey)`**: Handles the entire process of starting an SSL client, including TCP connection initiation, random number generation seeding, SSL/TLS defaults setup, authentication, and SSL handshake.
- **`init_tcp_connection(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *host, uint32_t port)`**: Initializes a TCP connection to a remote host.
- **`seed_random_number_generator(sslclient_context *ssl_client)`**: Seeds the random number generator critical for SSL/TLS operations.
- **`set_up_tls_defaults(sslclient_context *ssl_client)`**: Sets up SSL/TLS configuration with default settings.
- **`auth_root_ca_buff(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *rootCABuff, bool *ca_cert_initialized, const char *pskIdent, const char *psKey)`**: Configures SSL/TLS authentication options based on provided CA certificates or pre-shared keys.
- **`auth_client_cert_key(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *cli_cert, const char *cli_key, bool *client_cert_initialized, bool *client_key_initialized)`**: Loads and initializes the client's certificate and private key for SSL/TLS authentication.
- **`set_hostname_for_tls(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *host)`**: Sets the hostname for the TLS session, which should match the Common Name (CN) in the server's certificate.

## SSL Handshake and Verification
- **`perform_ssl_handshake(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *cli_cert, const char *cli_key)`**: Manages the SSL/TLS handshake process.
- **`verify_server_cert(sslclient_context *ssl_client)`**: Verifies the server's certificate against the provided root CA.

## Data Transmission and Reception
- **`data_to_read(sslclient_context *ssl_client)`**: Checks if there is data available to read from the SSL connection.
- **`send_ssl_data(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const uint8_t *data, size_t len)`**: Sends data over an established SSL connection.
- **`get_ssl_receive(sslclient_context *ssl_client, uint8_t *data, size_t length)`**: Receives data from the SSL connection.

## Certificate Validation
- **`verify_ssl_fingerprint(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char* fp, const char* domain_name)`**: Verifies the certificate provided by the peer against a specified SHA256 fingerprint.
- **`verify_ssl_dn(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char* domain_name)`**: Checks if the peer certificate contains the specified domain name in its Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SANs).

## Utility Functions
- **`parse_hex_nibble(char pb, uint8_t* res)`**: Parses a hexadecimal nibble into its binary representation.
- **`match_name(const string& name, const string& domainName)`**: Compares a name from a certificate to a domain name to check if they match.

## Cleanup and Socket Management
- **`stop_ssl_socket(sslclient_context *ssl_client, const char *rootCABuff, const char *cli_cert, const char *cli_key)`**: Stops the SSL socket and frees associated resources.

This user guide provides a comprehensive overview of each function, offering insights into how to use the SSLClient library effectively for secure communication in Arduino-based projects. Each function is designed to handle specific aspects of SSL/TLS communication, from establishing connections and handling data transmission to managing certificates and ensuring security.
